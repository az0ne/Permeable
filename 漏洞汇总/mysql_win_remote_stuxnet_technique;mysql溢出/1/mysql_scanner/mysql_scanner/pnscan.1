.PP
This manual page documents briefly the
\fBpnscan\fR command.
.PP
\fBpnscan\fR is a tool that can be used to survey
TCP network services.

When used with two command line arguments it will scan the indicated
network/hosts and ports. When used without arguments or just one then
it will read hostname/IP addresses from stdin and probe those. The single
port/service argument is used as a default if no port is indicated on stdin

For example, it can be used to survey the installed versions of
SSH, FTP, SMTP, Web, IDENT and possibly other services.
