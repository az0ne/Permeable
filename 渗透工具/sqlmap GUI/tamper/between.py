    Replaces greater than operator ('>') with 'NOT BETWEEN 0 AND #'

    Example:
        * Input: 'A > B'
        * Output: 'A NOT BETWEEN 0 AND B'

    Tested against:
        * Microsoft SQL Server 2005
        * MySQL 4, 5.0 and 5.5
        * Oracle 10g
        * PostgreSQL 8.3, 8.4, 9.0

    Notes:
        * Useful to bypass weak and bespoke web application firewalls that
          filter the greater than character
        * The BETWEEN clause is SQL standard. Hence, this tamper script
          should work against all (?) databases
